      <h1>Historical and Cultural Context of <em>The Odyssey</em></h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Influences of Ancient Greek Society</h2>
      <p>
        <em>The Odyssey</em>, attributed to Homer, was composed around the 8th century BCE during the Archaic period of Greek history. This era saw the rise of city-states (poleis), the development of Greek identity, and the preservation of oral traditions in written form. The epic reflects the hierarchical nature of Greek society, emphasizing aristocracy, honor, and hospitality (<em>xenia</em>). Odysseus, the protagonist, embodies the Greek ideal of intelligence and cunning (<em>metis</em>), rather than relying solely on physical strength. The portrayal of women, such as the loyal Penelope and the powerful Circe and Calypso, highlights the societal roles and expectations of the time.

      <h2>Religious Influences</h2>
      <p>
        Greek religion significantly shaped the narrative of <em>The Odyssey</em>. Gods and goddesses like Athena, Poseidon, and Zeus actively intervene in human affairs, reflecting the Greek belief in divine influence over fate. The epic emphasizes the importance of piety, with characters offering sacrifices and prayers to gain divine favor. Justice (<em>dike</em>), a key theme, is depicted through both divine retribution and human actions, as seen in Odysseus’ vengeance against the suitors.

      <h2>Oral Storytelling Traditions</h2>
      <p>
        <em>The Odyssey</em> was originally part of an oral tradition, passed down by bards (<em>aoidoi</em>). These poets relied on repeated phrases, epithets like “rosy-fingered Dawn,” and a structured narrative style to aid memorization and performance. The epic is written in <em>dactylic hexameter</em>, a rhythmic meter that made recitation easier. This tradition ensured that heroic ideals and cultural values were preserved long before widespread literacy in Greece.

      <p>
        <em>The Odyssey</em> reflects the values, beliefs, and traditions of Archaic Greece. It serves as both an entertaining epic and a moral guide, providing insight into Greek identity, divine-human relationships, and the rich storytelling heritage that shaped Western literature.
